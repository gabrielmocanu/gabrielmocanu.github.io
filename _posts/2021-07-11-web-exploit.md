Nowadays web applications are everywhere, so their security is an important point. My passion for this was after attending [this](https://github.com/hexcellents/sss-web) summer school, a summer school within the Faculty of Automation and Computers where I learned the main types of vulnerabilities on the web.

At this moment I help to develop the content for sessions and create challenges for the current participants. Here we talk about general security things, such as broken access control, injection attacks, frameworks vulnerabilities, secure communication.
