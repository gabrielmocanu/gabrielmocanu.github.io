I started this project because I never have a startup file for different applications when it comes to configurations. I always had to look for how to set a certain thing that I didn't use very often. So I thought of developing a [repository](https://github.com/gabrielmocanu/Templates) full of such templates.

## Bash script
So far I have made a [template](https://github.com/gabrielmocanu/Templates/tree/main/bash-script) for a bash script that receives certain parameters, these can be optional or mandatory, and depending on how they are set I can execute a certain thing I want.

## Future development
In the future, I set out to develop templates for Dockerfile, Docker-Compose file, Makefile, Xen configuration file.
